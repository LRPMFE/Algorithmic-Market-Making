# Algorithmic-Market-Making
This is a an Applied Finance Project (AFP) during my graduate study. We had a group of 4 members as well as a faculty advisor (the most handsome professor in our program). We dedicated a hald year working on this project with a sponsoring company. Since we were really interested in applying stochastic calculus into high frequency trading, we chose the topipc <b>Algorithmic Markte Making</b>. The firm we worked with was a hedge fund that specialized in OTC trading and algorithmic market making in the crypto space. I really appreciate the help and direction from the sponsoring company, the guidance and advice from our advisor, and the perfect team work of our group members.
